# OpenAI Proxy: Feature Overview

## Feature Description
Athena provides a lightweight proxy that enables seamless API translation between Anthropic and OpenRouter/OpenAI formats, allowing Claude Code to access diverse AI models with native API compatibility.

## Key Acceptance Criteria

1. **Bidirectional Format Translation**
   - Transform Anthropic API requests to OpenAI/OpenRouter format
   - Preserve semantic equivalence of message structure and content
   - Support both streaming and non-streaming modes

2. **Strict Compatibility Enforcement**
   - Validate and reject unsupported Anthropic API features
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different model providers
   - Maintain high fidelity to original API calling patterns

3. **Comprehensive Tool/Function Support**
   - Translate tool definitions and call schemas
   - Clean JSON schemas for cross-provider compatibility
   - Validate tool usage and responses

## Critical Business Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Strict Mode | Reject requests with unsupported Anthropic features |
| Model Naming | Prefix model names with 'anthropic/' for OpenRouter |
| System Prompts | Convert to first message in OpenAI messages array |
| Error Handling | Transform errors to match Anthropic's format |
| Token Mapping | Rename token statistics for consistent reporting |

## Technical Essentials

### Transformation Components
- Cobra CLI framework for command-line interface
- HTTP server in `internal/server/server.go`
- Core transformation logic in `internal/transform/transform.go`
- Supports complex content types (text, multi-modal)
- Handles tool/function translations
- Minimal external dependencies (Cobra CLI framework)

### Performance Profile
- Latency: <1ms per transformation
- Throughput: 1000+ req/sec
- Memory footprint: <100KB per request

## Implementation Status
**Production-Ready**: Fully implemented, tested, and deployed. Supports core Claude Code workflows with OpenRouter integration.
