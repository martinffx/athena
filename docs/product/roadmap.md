## Next Priorities ðŸŽ¯

### Phase 1: Enhancement & Polish (Q1 2024)
1. **Observability improvements**
   - Request/response logging with configurable levels
   - Metrics collection (request counts, latency, error rates)
   - Prometheus metrics endpoint for monitoring

2. **Advanced configuration**
   - Per-model timeout configurations
   - Custom retry policies for upstream failures
   - Rate limiting per model/provider

3. **Developer experience**
   - Improved error messages with troubleshooting guidance
   - Configuration validation with helpful error reporting
   - Debug mode with detailed request/response logging

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Q2 2024)
1. **Multi-provider resilience**
   - Automatic failover between providers for same model
   - Provider health checking and circuit breaker patterns
   - Cost optimization through provider selection

2. **Enhanced model mapping**
   - Dynamic model discovery from OpenRouter
   - Model capability matching (context length, tool support)
   - User-defined model aliases and tags

3. **Enterprise features**
   - API key rotation and management
   - Usage tracking and billing insights
   - Multi-tenant configuration support

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (Q3 2024)
1. **Local model ecosystem**
   - Enhanced Ollama integration with model auto-discovery
   - Support for additional local model servers (LM Studio, GPT4All)
   - Model format detection and automatic configuration

2. **Claude Code optimizations**
   - Caching layer for repeated requests
   - Request batching for efficiency
   - Custom model recommendations based on task type

## Success Metrics & Targets

### Adoption Metrics
- **Monthly active users**: Target 1,000+ Claude Code users by Q2 2024
- **Model diversity**: Average 5+ different models used per active user
